## Mission

The Informatics Club was founded to foster a community for UAB students and trainees
who are interest in informatics (including bioinformatics and health/clinical informatics)
through professional development, social activites, and community service.

## History

In the fall of 2019, the Informatics Club was founded by a group of UAB students including former president, Dr. Tarun
Mamidi. The club has since grown to include a diverse group of students and trainees from various disciplines
including computer science, biomedical sciences, dentistry, health informatics, and medicine.

In the past few years, our club has organized a virtual hackathon ([Hackin' Omics in 2022](https://hackathon.ubrite.org/hackathon-2022/)) with over 100 participants, received the Campus Impact Award from UAB's Student Involvement and Leadership Office in April 2023, and helped co-sponsor/support workshops and other events.
