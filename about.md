## Mission

The Informatics Club was founded to foster a community for UAB students and trainees
who are interest in informatics (including bioinformatics and health/clinical informatics)
through professional development, social activites, and community service.

## History

In the fall of 2019, the Informatics Club was founded by a group of UAB students including former president, Dr. Tarun
Mamidi. The club has since grown to include a diverse group of students and trainees from various disciplines
including computer science, biomedical sciences, dentistry, health informatics, and medicine.

Over the last few years, our club has organized a virtual hackathon ([Hackin' Omics in 2022](https://hackathon.ubrite.org/hackathon-2022/)) with over 100 participants and received the Campus Impact Award from UAB's Student Involvement and Leadership Office in April 2023.

We have also co-sponsored and supported programming workshops. In fact, after the height of the pandemic, the Informatics Club was one of the first student organizations to host an in-person workshop at UAB with the help of Dr. Blake Joyce and UAB's Research Computing.
