On November 16, 2023, the UAB Informatics Club hosted its student informatics presentation series, featuring Mattie Logan, a second-year Master of Science in Health Informatics student. In the realm of user experience (UX) research, the pursuit of creating innovative and impactful solutions often depends on understanding the human element at a deeper level. Mattie's talk, titled "UX Research Article Analysis: A Human-Centered Designed Outreach Strategy for a Youth Contraception Navigator Program," shed light on an initiative that aims to inform and support youth in informed decision-making about contraception in a manner that resonates with needs, preferences, and behaviors.

The presentation took a deep dive into the core tenets of human-centered design emphasizing the importance of understanding, iterative design, and continuous user feedback. At its heart lay the objective of crafting an outreach strategy that goes beyond the dissemination of information to actively engage and empower the target demographic: the youth.

The process began with comprehensive user research where the student embarked on an in-depth exploration of how researchers identified the target audience's attitudes, knowledge gaps, cultural nuances, and barriers to seeking contraception-related information. This initial phase illuminated diverse needs and challenges faced by young individuals in navigating contraceptive choices ranging from lack of information to stigma.

Armed with these insights, the team adopted an iterative design approach and developed prototyped materials and communication messages. This phase was marked with constant refinement and various messages that resonated with the test participants. Through designing messages based on participant feedback, researchers were able to foster a safe and inclusive space for open dialogue to help empower youth to make informed decisions confidently.

Furthermore, the presentation underscored the importance of collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches in UX research. Through leveraging insights from technology, communication, sociology, and public health, the team was able to design a multifaceted strategy that aligns with the diverse needs of the target audience.

The culminating strategy unveiled during the presentation was a testament to the power of human-centered design in addressing sensitive and crucial topics. It demonstrated a nuanced understanding of the target audience's needs while advocating for a more empathetic, inclusive approach to healthcare outreach.

The impact of this project extends far beyond its immediate scope. It serves as a compelling example of how human-centered design methodologies can drive meaningful change, especially in domains where empathy, understanding, and destigmatization are pivotal. The Youth Contraception Navigator Program's innovative approach not only informs the design of future healthcare initiatives but also champions a paradigm shift towards more compassionate and effective outreach strategies.

This student presentation showcased the transformative potential of UX research. By placing the human experience at the forefront, the project offered insights and strategies that could pave the way for a more inclusive, informed, and empowered youth population when it comes to critical decision-making about their reproductive health.
